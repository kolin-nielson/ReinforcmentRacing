# Reinforced Racing: AI Racing Agent Technical Overview

## Project Summary

Reinforced Racing is an advanced AI racing simulation that leverages Unity ML-Agents to create autonomous racing agents through reinforcement learning. The system trains agents to navigate complex racing tracks at high speeds, find optimal racing lines, and recover from errors without resetting. The project combines realistic vehicle physics with sophisticated boundary detection and neural network-based decision making.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Vehicle System**
   - `VehicleController`: Physics-based car simulation with suspension, engine power curves, and aerodynamics
   - `InputManager`: Handles input switching between AI and human control
   - `BodyFriction`: Enhances Unity physics with lateral friction for realistic cornering

2. **Track System**
   - `CheckpointGenerator`: Automatically creates checkpoints along the racing line
   - `TrackBoundaryDetector`: Uses raycasting to identify track boundaries and creates collision triggers
   - `RaceManager`: Coordinates race events, timing, and scoring

3. **AI System**
   - `RacingAgent`: ML-Agents agent that learns racing behaviors through reinforcement learning
   - `CarSpawnerManager`: Manages vehicle instantiation and training environment setup
   - `RecoveryDemoRecorder`: Records human demonstrations for imitation learning

### Technical Specifications

- Reinforcement learning using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- Neural network: 3 hidden layers with 512 units each
- Uses memory (LSTM) for temporal pattern recognition
- Observation space: 9 vehicle state parameters + checkpoint data + raycast data
- Action space: Continuous (steering, acceleration, braking)
- Training configuration in `racing_config.yaml`

## ML-Agent Training Process

### Agent Capabilities

The racing agent learns to:
- Drive at maximum possible speed while staying on track
- Follow optimal racing lines through corners
- Recover from errors when going off-track or losing control
- Adapt to different track layouts
- Complete laps in minimum time

### Observation Space (What the AI Perceives)

1. **Vehicle State**:
   - Local velocity (x, y, z relative to car)
   - Angular velocity (x, y, z)
   - Ground contact status
   - Track position status (on/off track)
   - Orientation relative to up vector
   - Off-track history state

2. **Track Information**:
   - Distances and directions to upcoming checkpoints (up to 8)
   - Raycasts (36-48) for boundary detection at different angles
   - Track surface normal information

3. **Learning Memory**:
   - Sequence memory of 128 steps
   - Memory size of 256 units

### Action Space (AI Controls)

The agent outputs continuous values for:
- Steering: -1.0 to 1.0 (left to right)
- Acceleration: 0.0 to 1.0 (none to full throttle)
- Braking: 0.0 to 1.0 (none to full braking)

### Reward System

The agent is trained with a sophisticated reward system:

1. **Positive Rewards**:
   - `checkpointReward`: Small reward for hitting checkpoints (0.01)
   - `lapCompletionReward`: Reward for completing a lap (0.5)
   - `speedRewardFactor`: Continuous reward for high speed (0.2)
   - `progressRewardFactor`: Reward for making progress toward next checkpoint (0.5)
   - `centerlineRewardFactor`: Small reward for following the optimal racing line (0.01)
   - `recoveryReward`: Significant reward for returning to track after going off-track (2.0)
   - `beatBestLapBonus`: Large bonus for beating previous best lap time (50.0)

2. **Negative Rewards (Penalties)**:
   - `timePenalty`: Small continuous penalty encouraging faster completion (-0.006)
   - `boundaryHitPenalty`: Penalty for hitting track boundaries (-1.5)
   - `continuousOffTrackPenalty`: Ongoing penalty while off-track (-0.1)
   - `wrongCheckpointPenalty`: Penalty for hitting checkpoints out of order (-1.0)
   - `resetPenalty`: Penalty applied on failure requiring reset (-2.0)

### Training Configuration Highlights

From `racing_config.yaml`:
- Batch size: 2048
- Buffer size: 32768
- Learning rate: 0.0003
- Beta (exploration): 0.015
- Gamma (future rewards): 0.995
- Training steps: 30 million
- Includes GAIL imitation learning from demonstrations
- Optional self-play for competitive learning

## Error Recovery System

A key innovation in this implementation is the ability to recover from errors rather than resetting:

1. **Error Detection**
   - Boundary collision detection via trigger colliders
   - Off-track state monitoring
   - Vehicle orientation monitoring (for rollovers)
   - Progress timeout detection (for getting stuck)

2. **Recovery Training**
   - Modified reward structure that doesn't immediately reset on error
   - `recoveryReward` to incentivize returning to track
   - Reduced penalties during recovery to allow exploration
   - `RecoveryDemoRecorder` for creating human demonstrations of recovery behavior
   - GAIL imitation learning to learn from human recovery examples

3. **Parameters Controlling Recovery**
   - `resetOnBoundaryHit`: Set to false to enable recovery learning
   - `progressTimeout`: Extended to allow more time for recovery (15.0 seconds)
   - `upsideDownTimeThreshold`: Longer time before resetting upside-down vehicles (3.0 seconds)
   - `minCheckpointFractionForLap`: Reduced to be more forgiving (0.9 or 90%)

## Customization and Extensibility

The system supports:
- Custom track layouts (auto-detected with raycasting)
- Custom vehicle prefabs (with proper component setup)
- Training parameter adjustment via Unity Inspector
- Curriculum learning for progressive difficulty
- Multi-agent training with optional self-play

## Usage Guidelines

### Training Process

1. Configure vehicle and track in Unity scene
2. Adjust training parameters in RacingAgent component

5. Monitor progress via TensorBoard
6. Test intermediate models for both lap times and recovery ability

### Vehicle Setup Requirements

The racing vehicle requires:
- Rigidbody with proper physics settings
- Wheel colliders or custom wheel physics
- VehicleController component
